# Channel architecture

This document describes the channel-agnostic layer that replaces eBay-specific
plumbing throughout the marketplace-sync stack, so Google Shopping and Meta
Shop (built later) plug into the same contract eBay now does. It covers the
adapter contract, the data model, the job/queue flow, the deploy order, and
the rollback procedure.

eBay's own behavior is unchanged end-to-end by this migration — every
existing eBay flow (publish, update, end, inventory push, inventory
poll-back, order ingest, webhooks, refunds) still works exactly as it did
before. What changed is *where* the generic parts of that plumbing live.

## 1. Adapter contract

Every marketplace adapter (`services/marketplace/adapters/*.adapter.js`)
exports:

```js
{
  key,            // platform key, e.g. "ebay"
  manifest,       // { key, name, logo, description, status, authType, setupSteps, requiredTenantData,
                  //   requiresStorefront?, fieldSchema, productConstraints? }   — see §13
  capabilities,   // { publish, inventory, batch, orders, webhooks, inboundInventory, variants }
  needs,          // optional { branding?, stock?, productUrl? } — I/O the resolver hydrates (§13)
  categoryField,  // optional listing field holding the channel category (§13)
  loadSettings(tenantId), // -> resolved connection/settings object, or null if not connected
  publish(resolved, settings, hooks?, seq?),
  update(resolved, settings, hooks?, seq?),
  end(listing, { product, variant, settings, sku }),
  publishBatch(...), // optional — omitted by eBay
  syncBaselineFields(quantity), // optional — extra fields stamped with the sync baseline
}
```

Adapters are **pure translators** (§13): no model imports, no `inventory.service`,
no mid-function `require`s.

`registry.js` (`services/marketplace/registry.js`) holds every registered
adapter:

- `register(adapter)` — called once at process startup (see
  `services/marketplace/registerAdapters.js`, used by both the API process
  and the channel worker).
- `has(platform)` / `get(platform)` (alias: `getAdapter`) — `get` throws a
  clear "No marketplace adapter registered for: X" error for an unknown
  platform; `has` is the non-throwing check used by fan-out and the channel
  routes.
- `list()` — every registered adapter's `manifest`, used by `GET
  /api/v1/channels`.
- `getAll()` — every registered adapter object, used by the worker to attach
  a queue processor per platform.

`services/marketplace/sync.service.js` is the platform-agnostic dispatcher.
It no longer has any eBay-specific branching: it resolves the adapter via
the registry, calls `adapter.loadSettings(tenantId)` instead of a hardcoded
per-platform switch, and guards on `adapter.capabilities.inventory` so a
catalog-only adapter's inventory-refresh jobs become a clean no-op instead of
a crash. A tenant with no connection at all (`loadSettings` resolves to
`null`) is a clean "not connected" skip, never an unhandled rejection.

eBay's own adapter (`adapters/ebay.adapter.js`) still owns every eBay HTTP
call exactly as before; the only additions are `manifest`, `capabilities`
(`publish`/`inventory`/`orders`/`webhooks`/`inboundInventory`/`variants`:
`true`, `batch`: `false`), and `loadSettings`, which just wraps the existing
`ebay.settings.service.js#getSettings` — see the `// NOTE:` in that file for
why it deliberately never returns `null` (an unconfigured eBay tenant still
gets today's exact "credentials not configured" error/retry behavior, not
the new generic skip, since that's what "zero behavior change" requires).

## 2. Data model

### MarketplaceListing (existing collection, unchanged name)

`push_seq` / `last_pushed_seq` moved from the eBay discriminator onto the
**base** schema (default `0`) — `sync.service.js` reads them for every
platform, so a non-eBay listing used to silently get `undefined` fencing
values. A generic `synced_quantity` field was added to the base schema as
the channel-agnostic loop-prevention baseline.

`ebay_synced_quantity` stays on the eBay discriminator, marked deprecated.
During the transition every write site dual-writes both
`ebay_synced_quantity` (deprecated) and `synced_quantity` (generic) —
search for `TODO(dual-write)` to find every site. The read convention going
forward is `synced_quantity ?? ebay_synced_quantity ?? null`.
`ebay.inventory-sync.service.js` (the existing eBay-only reconciliation
poller) was left reading `ebay_synced_quantity` directly — untouched, since
generalizing that poller isn't in scope here and the dual-write keeps it
accurate regardless.

Every fencing comparison coalesces with `?? 0` rather than assuming Mongoose
applies the schema default on every read path (it does on a hydrated
document, not on `.lean()`).

New indexes (background): `{ tenant_id, platform, sync_status }` and
`{ tenant_id, platform, synced_at: -1 }`.

### ChannelConnection (new collection, discriminator key `platform`)

Replaces `EbaySettings` as the channel-agnostic connection record. Base
schema: `tenant_id`, `platform`, `status`
(`connected`/`disconnected`/`degraded`/`error`), `external_account_id`,
`access_token_ct` / `refresh_token_ct` (single packed ciphertext string per
token — see §3), `token_expires_at`, `webhook_token`, `connected_at`,
`last_error`, `consecutive_failures`, `last_success_at`, `disabled_at`.
Unique index on `{ tenant_id, platform }`; a separate global unique+sparse
index on `webhook_token` (it has no tenant in its own URL, so it must be
resolvable on its own — see §3).

The eBay discriminator carries every eBay-specific field from
`EbaySettings.js` verbatim: `marketplace_id`, `sandbox`,
`merchant_location_key`, the three business policy ids, the warehouse
address fields, `fallback_image_url`, `verification_token`.

It's registered under the Mongoose model name `ChannelConnectionEbay`, not
`ebay` — `MarketplaceListing` already has a discriminator model literally
named `ebay`, and Mongoose discriminator names are unique per connection,
not per base model, so reusing the same name throws `OverwriteModelError`.
The 3rd argument to `.discriminator(name, schema, value)` keeps the actual
stored `platform` value as `"ebay"` (`MARKETPLACE_PLATFORM.EBAY`) — every
query elsewhere is unaffected.

### ChannelSyncLog (new collection)

Append-only audit trail written from `sync.service.js`: `tenant_id`,
`platform`, `job_type`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `status`
(`success`/`failure`/`skipped`), `attempt`, `error_code`, `error_message`,
`request_summary`, `duration_ms`. TTL index on `created_at`
(`config.channels.syncLogTtlDays`, default 30). Failures are always logged
in full; successes/skips only when `config.channels.logSuccesses` is set
(default `false`), so a full catalogue sync doesn't write thousands of rows.
All log writes are wrapped in try/catch — logging can never break a job.

### EbaySettings (existing collection, untouched)

Left in place as the legacy source of truth during the transition — not
deleted, not modified. See §4.

## 3. Migration strategy: EbaySettings → ChannelConnection

Lazy read-through, because the system is live and cannot take a maintenance
window:

- **Read** (`ebay.settings.service.js#getSettings`): look up
  `ChannelConnection { tenant_id, platform: "ebay" }`. If absent, read the
  legacy `EbaySettings` doc, upsert it into `ChannelConnection` (idempotent —
  `findOneAndUpdate` with `$setOnInsert`, protected by the unique index; a
  concurrent duplicate-key error is caught and re-read rather than erring),
  and return that.
- **Write** (`upsertSettings`, `markConnectionError`,
  `ensureVerificationToken`, `ensureWebhookToken`): `ChannelConnection`
  only — but `upsertSettings` first calls `ensureMigrated`, which runs the
  same lazy migration if no `ChannelConnection` row exists yet. Without
  this, a partial update (e.g. "just change the warehouse phone number") on
  a tenant who's already connected via the legacy row, but hasn't triggered
  a lazy migration yet, would silently create a bare `ChannelConnection`
  missing their refresh token — orphaning a live connection.
- **`findByWebhookToken`**: tries `ChannelConnection` first, falls back to
  `EbaySettings` (and lazily migrates on the way) — a real inbound eBay
  webhook delivery must resolve correctly immediately after this code
  deploys, for every already-connected tenant, none of whom have a
  `ChannelConnection` row yet at that point.
- **`listConfiguredTenants`**: sourced from `EbaySettings` (authoritative
  until the bulk migration script runs), lazily migrating each tenant along
  the way; also includes any tenant connected directly through
  `ChannelConnection` with no legacy row at all.
- The lazy migration **never throws into the caller's request path** — every
  call site falls back to reading `EbaySettings` directly on failure.

**Public shape is unchanged.** `getSettings`/`upsertSettings`/
`findByWebhookToken` still return the exact same field names/values
(`marketplace_id`, `sandbox`, `connection_status`, `refresh_token`, ...) as
before — the frontend (`ebaySettingsService.ts` et al) is untouched and
still reads this shape. `toLegacyShape()`/`fieldsFromLegacy()` in
`ebay.settings.service.js` are the one place that translates between the two
models.

**Token ciphertext**: `tokenCipher.js` is unchanged and still produces
`{ ciphertext, iv, tag }`. `ChannelConnection`'s generic contract has a
single `refresh_token_ct` string (shared across every future platform's
cipher shape), so the three parts are packed into one delimited string
(`"<iv>.<tag>.<ciphertext>"`, base64 never contains `.`) rather than
widening the schema for one platform. This is a repackaging, not a
decrypt/re-encrypt — the underlying AES-GCM ciphertext bytes are copied
verbatim.

**Bulk migration script** —
`server/scripts/migrateEbaySettingsToChannelConnection.js`:

```
node scripts/migrateEbaySettingsToChannelConnection.js [--dry-run] [--tenant=<tenantId>]
```

Idempotent (skips a tenant that already has a `ChannelConnection`, never
overwrites it), `--dry-run` writes nothing, logs a per-tenant and summary
count. Exports `run({ dryRun, tenantId, log, logError })` so it's testable
directly rather than only as a subprocess — see
`src/services/ebay/ebay.settings.migration-script.test.js`.

## 4. Job / queue flow

`queues/channel.queue.js` exports a `queues` map keyed by platform and
`enqueueChannelJob(platform, jobName, payload, opts)`. eBay's Bull queue
name stays exactly `"ebay"` (job names `sync_listing`/`poll_orders`/
`poll_inventory` unchanged too) — there can be jobs already sitting in Redis
at deploy time, and renaming the queue would orphan them.

`sync_listing` jobs are debounced: `jobId: sync:<platform>:<listingId>`,
`delay: config.channels.debounceMs` (default 5000ms), `removeOnComplete:
true` (**mandatory** — a completed job with a custom jobId stays in Redis's
completed set otherwise, and a later `.add()` with the same id is silently
ignored forever), `removeOnFail: false`. N rapid calls for the same listing
collapse into one job; the eventual job re-reads the listing's *current*
`push_seq` at execution time rather than trusting whichever payload's `seq`
happened to win the dedup, so this is safe. The old job-payload shape
(`{ listingId, seq }`) is unchanged and still processed correctly by the
worker.

`queues/ebay.queue.js` (the backward-compat shim) and
`channel.queue.js#registerEnqueueOverride` have been **removed** (§13). Every
caller uses `enqueueChannelJob(platform, ...)`; the Bull queue name for eBay is
still exactly `"ebay"` (`QUEUE_NAMES` untouched) and job names are unchanged.
`inventory.service.js` calls `channelQueue.enqueueChannelJob(...)` through the
module object, so a test's `mock.method()` applies whenever it is installed.

Per-queue rate limiting (`limiter: { max, duration }`) is read from
`config.channels.rateLimits[platform]`; eBay's has never had one, so it
stays unset by default — set `EBAY_QUEUE_RATE_MAX`/`_DURATION_MS` to opt in.

### Inventory fan-out

`inventory.service.js#fanOutMarketplaceInventory` now calls
`enqueueChannelJob(listing.platform, ...)` instead of a hardcoded
`enqueueEbayJob`. It iterates every active listing across every platform for
a product; a listing whose platform has no registered adapter is skipped
with a warning (never throws), and each platform's enqueue is wrapped
individually so one platform's failure never blocks another's.

**Product/variant edit fan-out (`controllers/product.controller.js`):**
Originally only a stock/quantity change (via `adjustStock`/`setStock` above)
ever called `fanOutMarketplaceInventory` — a plain product edit (price,
title, description, photos, brand, mpn) saved to Mongo and reindexed search,
but never told any channel anything changed. Worst for Google: a Google
listing carries almost no fields of its own (see the adapter section below),
so title/description/price/photos come from the Product with no per-listing
override in the common case — a price edit could disagree with the Merchant
Center feed for up to `CHANNEL_REFRESH_INTERVAL_DAYS` (25) days, itself a
disapproval risk.

Fixed by snapshotting a fixed set of marketplace-relevant Product fields
(`title`, `description`, `price`, `brand`, `mpn`, `condition`, `attachments`)
before `updateProduct` mutates the document and diffing against the same
snapshot after save — a change fans out to the base (no-variant) listings
AND every variant's own listings (a variant without its own price/photo
override falls back to the product's), via the SAME
`fanOutMarketplaceInventory` function stock changes already use — no second
implementation. An edit to a field no adapter reads (internal notes,
categories, vehicle catalog, `is_taxable`, ...) fans out to nothing.
`updateVariant` gets the analogous treatment scoped to `price`/`sku`/
`attachments` (a variant has no title/description/brand/mpn/condition of its
own), fanning out only to that variant's own listings. Both paths are
best-effort — a queue failure is logged and never fails the HTTP response,
same convention as the existing search-reindex enqueue.

`createProduct`/`duplicateProduct` do NOT fan out: a `MarketplaceListing` is
always created via its own separate "list on eBay/Google" action, never as a
side effect of product creation, so at the moment either handler returns
there are unconditionally zero listings to push to.

### Circuit breaker (`services/marketplace/circuitBreaker.js`)

Per-`(tenant, platform)`, backed by `ChannelConnection.consecutive_failures`/
`status`. Only transport/auth-level failures count (`status >= 500`, `401`,
`403`, or no HTTP status at all i.e. a network/timeout error) — a 400-level
per-item validation failure (bad category, missing GTIN) never does, since
that's a product-data problem, not evidence the connection is broken. At
`config.channels.circuitBreakerThreshold` (default 10) consecutive counted
failures, `status` flips to `degraded` and `sync.service.js#syncListing`
skips further syncs for that tenant+platform until an explicit `resume()`
(used by the reconnect/manual-sync flow) or the reconnect flow clears it.

**Deliberate deviation from a literal reading of "pause that platform's
queue":** eBay's Bull queue is shared across every tenant. A literal
`queue.pause()` on breaker-trip would stall every *other* tenant's eBay sync
because of *one* tenant's broken credentials — a worse outage than the one
the breaker exists to prevent. Implemented instead as a per-tenant gate
`sync.service.js` checks before calling the adapter, which gets the same
practical effect (stop hammering a confirmed-broken connection) without the
cross-tenant blast radius.

### Worker consolidation (`workers/channel.worker.js`)

Registers every adapter, then attaches a `sync_listing` processor per
platform's queue at per-platform concurrency (`SYNC_LISTING_CONCURRENCY` —
eBay stays at `1`, its existing concurrency, unchanged). eBay's
`poll_orders`/`poll_inventory` handlers and their repeatable schedules are
wired directly (not part of the generic per-platform loop — no other
platform has an equivalent yet), ported unchanged from the old
`ebay.worker.js`. Handles `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`: Bull's `Queue#close()` already
stops picking up new jobs and waits for active ones before resolving; the
handler sequences that against closing the Mongo connection, then exits.

`workers/ebay.worker.js` is now a thin delegate:
`startChannelWorker({ platforms: ["ebay"] })` — kept as a separate entry
point purely so the *old* docker-compose (`worker-ebay: node
src/workers/ebay.worker.js`) keeps booting correctly if the code deploy
lands before the compose file change does (see §5).

`workers/platform.worker.js` merges the old `email.worker.js` and
`search.worker.js` into one process — both are low-volume, unrelated job
types that don't need a dedicated container each. Processing logic itself is
unchanged.

## 5. API routes (additive only)

`GET /api/v1/channels` — every registered adapter's manifest merged with
this tenant's connection status, capabilities, health
(`consecutive_failures`, `last_success_at`), and listing counts by
`sync_status`. TASK 5: also `available: boolean` +
`unavailable_reason: string | null` — `available` is `false` only when the
adapter's manifest sets `requiresStorefront: true` (Google today) AND this
tenant has no verified default `Domain`; `unavailable_reason` is then a
ready-to-show, human-readable string (never `null` in that case). Every
other adapter (eBay: no `requiresStorefront`) is always `available: true`.
See `channel.service.js#checkStorefrontRequirement` — the same generic
check `google.controller.js#getConnectUrl` runs before starting OAuth at
all, so a tenant can't be shown "available" here and then have the connect
attempt itself refuse them.

`GET /api/v1/channels/:platform/logs` — paginated `ChannelSyncLog`.

`POST /api/v1/channels/:platform/retry/:logId` — re-enqueues the listing
behind a failed/skipped log row (fresh `sync_listing` job, no fencing seq).

`:platform` is validated against the registry; an unknown platform is a
404. Registered in `routes/index.js` behind the same `auth()` middleware the
eBay routes use. `routes/ebay.routes.js` itself is untouched.

`GET /api/v1/listings?group_by=product` — one row per PRODUCT (with all of
that product's listings nested) instead of one row per listing, for the
Listings page's grouped table (see `listing.query.service.js#listListingsGroupedByProduct`).
Same `platform`/`state`/`sync_status`/`search` filters as the ungrouped
endpoint. **TASK 3 (a later run)**: those filters determine which
**products** qualify for the page — a product appears only if at least one
of its listings matches every active filter — but never which of a
qualifying product's **channels** are shown in its own row; a qualifying
row always carries that product's full, unfiltered listing set. Originally
the same filters were applied directly at the listing level before
grouping, so an active platform filter silently dropped a qualifying
product's other listings out of its own row, leaving a grey "not listed"
cell that could mean either "genuinely not listed" or "filtered out",
indistinguishably — the exact ambiguity a grouped, per-channel view exists
to avoid. Implemented as two aggregation passes over `MarketplaceListing`:
one finds the paginated set of qualifying product ids (filtered, as
before), the second re-fetches every listing for exactly those ids with no
filters at all.

## 6. Deploy order

1. **Deploy the code** (this migration). `EbaySettings` keeps working as the
   read/write source for any tenant not yet lazily migrated;
   `ChannelConnection` starts filling in on demand. `worker-ebay` (old
   compose) and `worker-channels` (new compose) both work correctly against
   the *current* production database at this point — nothing here depends
   on the migration script having run.
2. **Run the migration script** (optional but recommended before decommissioning
   `EbaySettings` reads):
   `node scripts/migrateEbaySettingsToChannelConnection.js` (drop `--dry-run`
   once the printed plan looks right). Safe to run repeatedly; safe to run
   while the app is live and taking traffic.
3. **Switch docker-compose**: replace `worker-ebay` with `worker-channels`
   (`node src/workers/channel.worker.js`), merge `worker-email`/
   `worker-search` into `worker-platform`. `worker-stripe` is untouched.
   `workers/ebay.worker.js` keeps working if this step is delayed relative
   to step 1 — it's a fully-functional restricted delegate to
   `channel.worker.js`, not a stub.

## 7. Rollback

- **Step 3 (compose) rollback**: revert `docker-compose.yml` to
  `worker-ebay`/`worker-email`/`worker-search`. `workers/ebay.worker.js`
  (step 1's code) still runs the exact same eBay processing as
  `channel.worker.js` restricted to eBay — no functional loss.
  `workers/email.worker.js`/`search.worker.js` were left in place, untouched,
  specifically so this rollback direction has something to point back at.
- **Step 2 (migration script) rollback**: none needed — it's additive-only
  (`ChannelConnection` rows) and never modifies or deletes `EbaySettings`.
  If a migrated `ChannelConnection` row is ever suspected wrong for a
  tenant, delete just that row; the lazy read-through will re-derive it from
  `EbaySettings` on the next read.
- **Step 1 (code) rollback**: reverting to the pre-migration code is safe as
  long as `EbaySettings` still has accurate data for every tenant that
  connected *before* the rollback point. A tenant who connects/reconnects
  *after* this migration deployed (writing only to `ChannelConnection`) would
  lose that specific update on a full code rollback — for that
  narrow window, re-run the OAuth connect flow once the rollback is live to
  re-populate `EbaySettings`. This is the same category of risk any
  storage-migrating deploy carries; `EbaySettings` is deliberately kept
  fully intact (not deleted, not migration-locked) specifically to keep this
  rollback path open.

## 8. `// NOTE:` decisions

A few ambiguous calls made in favor of the most backward-compatible option,
each with an inline `// NOTE:`/comment at the site:

- `ebay.adapter.js#loadSettings` never returns `null` (unlike the generic
  contract's convention) — an unconfigured eBay tenant keeps getting today's
  exact "credentials not configured" thrown error, not the new generic
  "not connected" skip.
- Circuit breaker trip is a per-tenant gate in `sync.service.js`, not a
  literal Bull `queue.pause()` — see §4.
- `ChannelConnection`'s eBay discriminator is registered as model name
  `ChannelConnectionEbay` (value still `"ebay"`) to avoid colliding with
  `MarketplaceListing`'s own `"ebay"` discriminator in Mongoose's global
  model registry.
- `degraded` (`ChannelConnection.status`, new) maps to legacy
  `connection_status: "error"` in `ebay.settings.service.js#getSettings` —
  the old enum has no equivalent value, and the frontend's `ebaySettings.ts`
  type isn't touched in this run.
- `access_token_ct`/`refresh_token_ct` each pack tokenCipher's
  `{ ciphertext, iv, tag }` triple into one delimited string, rather than
  widening `ChannelConnection`'s schema per-platform.

## 9. Google Shopping (second channel)

Added additively on top of everything above — eBay's own behavior is
unchanged; see §11 for exactly what was touched in the shared layer and why
each change is safe for eBay.

### Adapter (`adapters/google.adapter.js`)

Google is **feed-shaped, not listing-shaped**: there's no create-offer/
publish-offer sequence the way eBay has one. `publish()` and `update()` are
both just `productInputs.insert` (Merchant API's own upsert semantics) —
kept as two exports only because the registry contract requires both.
`external_offer_id` is always `null`; `external_listing_id` holds the
Merchant API product resource name's short form
(`contentLanguage~feedLabel~offerId`, literally — see
`buildProductResourceName`). Originally `channel~contentLanguage~feedLabel~offerId`
under v1beta; the `channel` segment (and the `channel`/`gtin` fields
elsewhere) were removed when this integration migrated to v1 after Google
discontinued v1beta on 2026-02-28 — see §9's own migration note below and
`google.merchant.api.service.js`'s module comment.

`loadSettings` follows the **generic** contract (returns `null` for a
tenant with no `ChannelConnection`) — unlike eBay's adapter, which
deliberately never does (see §8's first bullet). Google has no legacy
pre-`ChannelConnection` source to stay compatible with, so there's no reason
to deviate; `sync.service.js`'s existing "not connected" skip path (already
built for this exact contract) handles it.

Capabilities: `{ publish: true, inventory: true, batch: true, orders:
false, webhooks: false, inboundInventory: false, variants: true }`. No
order/webhook support in this run — Google Shopping isn't itself an
order-taking channel the way eBay is.

**v1beta → v1 migration (found live, 2026-09-05):** this integration was
originally written against Merchant API v1beta. Google discontinued
v1beta on 2026-02-28; a real connect attempt against the live API
surfaced this as a 409 `V1BETA_RAMP_DOWN` on `dataSources.list`, after an
earlier 400 on `dataSources.create` (`PrimaryProductDataSource.channel`
already rejecting `"ONLINE"` — v1beta was evidently rejecting some writes
even before the hard cutover). Fixed by moving both
`google.merchant.api.service.js` and `google.datasource.service.js`'s base
URLs from `/v1beta` to `/v1`, and updating every place the schema itself
changed (confirmed against Google's own migration guide and the real API
responses, not guessed):
- `PrimaryProductDataSource.channel` — **removed** in v1 (replaced by an
  optional `legacyLocal` boolean for local-only feeds; omitted here since
  this integration is never local-only).
- `ProductInput.channel` — **removed** in v1 entirely; no replacement
  needed at this level.
- `ProductAttributes.gtin` (string) → `ProductAttributes.gtins` (array) —
  `applyIdentifiers` now sends `[identifiers.gtin]`.
- The product resource id format dropped the channel segment:
  `channel~contentLanguage~feedLabel~offerId` (v1beta) →
  `contentLanguage~feedLabel~offerId` (v1) — see
  `buildProductResourceName`. Getting this one wrong is silent: a
  wrong/stale resource name 404s on delete, and `end()` already (validly)
  treats 404 as "already gone" success — so it would have looked like
  every `end()` call worked while never actually removing anything from
  Google.
- `google.controller.js#oauthCallback`'s catch block now also logs
  `err.cause` (where Node's `fetch` puts the real underlying reason for a
  generic "fetch failed" TypeError) — found live: an unrelated local
  IPv6-routing timeout to `merchantapi.googleapis.com` was indistinguishable
  from a real API rejection until this was added. Unrelated fix, applied
  alongside since it was in the same debugging session:
  `config/index.js` now sets `dns.setDefaultResultOrder("ipv4first")`
  process-wide (every entrypoint requires config first) so a broken/absent
  IPv6 route to any outbound host doesn't silently eat ~10s per call before
  falling back.

**GCP project developer registration (found live, same debugging session):**
past the v1 migration, a fresh GCP project's very first `dataSources.create`
call still failed — 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED`, reason `GCP_NOT_REGISTERED`.
Google requires a one-time `developerRegistration.registerGcp` call
(`accounts/v1/accounts/{merchantId}/developerRegistration:registerGcp`)
before ANY of a GCP project's Merchant API calls are trusted by a given
Merchant Center account — see
[the registration guide](https://developers.google.com/merchant/api/guides/quickstart/registration).
`google.datasource.service.js#createDataSource` now auto-recovers: on a
`GCP_NOT_REGISTERED` 401 specifically (never any other 401), it calls
`registerGcp` once, then throws a distinct `GCP_REGISTRATION_PENDING` error
(`.status = 503`) telling the caller to retry the whole connect flow after a
few minutes — it deliberately does NOT retry the create synchronously in the
same request: Google's own docs say registration can take up to ~5 minutes
to propagate, and a first attempt at an immediate retry was confirmed live
to fail with the exact same `GCP_NOT_REGISTERED` error. `google.controller.js`
maps this to a `registration_pending` reason on the OAuth redirect (and
`ALREADY_REGISTERED` from `registerGcp` itself to `GCP_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`
/ `registration_conflict` — see the constraint below). See also §12 for the
one-off `scripts/registerGoogleGcp.js` operator script that performs this
same registration directly, outside the connect flow.

**⚠️ Real architectural constraint, not just a one-off fix** — confirmed
against Google's own docs: *"Each Google Cloud project can only be
registered with a single Merchant Center account at any given time"* —
registering a second, different account returns `ALREADY_REGISTERED`. This
app's `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is **one shared GCP project across every tenant**
(mirrors `config.ebay`'s shared-app-credentials model — see §1). Under the
Merchant API's real constraints as they exist today, **that means only ONE
tenant's Merchant Center account can be connected at a time** under this
project — a second tenant's connect attempt will hit `registerGcp`'s
`ALREADY_REGISTERED` and surface a clear `GCP_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` error
(not a silent failure) rather than actually connecting. This needs a real
decision before onboarding a second real tenant: a separate GCP project per
tenant (more setup, but straightforward), or pursuing Google's Multi-Client
Account model (the mechanism real multi-merchant platforms use), or some
other resolution — not something to route around quietly in code.

**Product decisions baked into the adapter** (not re-litigated per listing):

- **Public URL** (`listing.resolver.js#resolveProductUrl`): the storefront
  (`pha-storefront`) is a separate repo; its product route is `/product/:slug`
  (**singular** — confirmed against its `src/App.tsx`). `platform` is now a
  **required 4th argument** (TASK 2, a later run) — see below. Host
  resolution, in order: (1) the tenant's **default** verified `Domain`
  (`is_default: true`, `DOMAIN_STATUS.ACTIVE` — a non-default active domain
  does not count); (2) for a platform whose manifest does **not** declare
  `requiresStorefront`, `<tenant.slug, hyphens stripped>.${config.payment.linkDomain}`
  — the same per-tenant host `stripe.payment.service.js#buildPaymentBaseUrl`
  already builds for payment links, reused rather than invented fresh. Throws
  — naming the SKU — when neither resolves: no default verified `Domain`
  **and** no `PAYMENT_LINK_DOMAIN` configured (or that platform isn't allowed
  the fallback at all — see below), or the product has no `slug` at all
  (`Product.slug` is not a required field).
  - **TASK 2 (a later run): the linkDomain fallback is refused entirely for
    any platform whose manifest declares `requiresStorefront: true`** — found
    as a real gap: §5 already makes a channel `unavailable` (and §9's connect
    flow already refuses to even start OAuth) for a tenant with no verified
    default `Domain`, on the reasoning that a shared
    `<slug>.PAYMENT_LINK_DOMAIN` subdomain isn't something a tenant could
    claim/verify ownership of with Google — but `resolveProductUrl` itself
    still built a URL on exactly that host regardless, for any tenant who
    got connected some other way (e.g. before that guard existed, or via
    direct DB access). Now `getPlatformManifest(platform)` (looked up off the
    registry, never assumed) gates the fallback: for a `requiresStorefront`
    platform, no verified `Domain` throws immediately, naming the platform,
    rather than silently building the disallowed URL. A platform without
    `requiresStorefront` (eBay, which never actually calls this function
    anyway) is completely unaffected — same fallback as always.
- **Identifiers** (`listing.resolver.js#resolveIdentifiers` +
  `google.adapter.js#applyIdentifiers`): `gtin` when present; else `mpn` +
  `brand` only when **both** are present; else `identifierExists: false`.
  Never invents/derives a value.
- **Untracked stock**: a product with `stock_control` off is excluded from
  Google entirely — enforced in the adapter (`isUntrackedStock`), signaled
  back to `sync.service.js` as `{ skipped: true, reason: "untracked_stock"
  }` (see §11), never published as `IN_STOCK`.
- **Availability**: `quantity > 0` → `"IN_STOCK"`; `0` → `"OUT_OF_STOCK"` —
  Merchant API v1's real ALL_CAPS enum. Originally shipped as the classic
  Content API's literal lowercase strings ("in stock"/"out of stock", the
  most-documented historical shape at the time, explicitly flagged as
  unverified — see `google.adapter.js`'s own module `NOTE`); a real
  `productInputs.insert` call confirmed that guess wrong (400
  `INVALID_ARGUMENT` on the `availability` field) and it was fixed against
  Google's own client library docs for the exact enum names.
- **Image URL validation** (`buildProductInputFromResolved`,
  `isAbsoluteHttpsUrl`, `GoogleImageValidationError`): previously mapped
  `resolved.photos` straight into `imageLink`/`additionalImageLinks` with no
  validation at all — Google *accepts* a non-HTTPS or otherwise unusable
  `imageLink` at `productInputs.insert` time and only disapproves the
  product later, asynchronously, off this app's radar. Same silent-failure
  shape eBay already guards against on its own side
  (`ebay.api.service.js#resolveImageUrls`: warns and drops non-HTTPS
  entries, throws if nothing usable is left). Now: if a primary image is
  **present but not** an absolute `https://` URL, `buildProductInputFromResolved`
  throws `GoogleImageValidationError` naming the SKU (`.status = 400`,
  `.code = "INVALID_IMAGE_URL"` — same convention as `ConditionUnverifiedError`
  on the eBay adapter), which `circuitBreaker.js#isTransportOrAuthFailure`
  correctly classifies as a per-item data problem (never trips the breaker),
  and `sync.service.js` already writes the resulting `ChannelSyncLog`
  FAILURE row generically for any thrown adapter error — no separate
  logging call needed in the adapter itself. A non-HTTPS **additional**
  image is dropped with a `logger.warn`, not fatal — Google can still list
  the product on its primary photo alone.
  - **TASK 1 (a later run): a product with ZERO photos is now rejected the
    same way.** Originally left as pre-existing behavior (`imageLink` stayed
    `null`, silently accepted) on the reasoning that Google's live API
    already 400s on a null `imageLink` — but that's exactly the same
    *silent*, *asynchronous* failure this whole check exists to close, just
    for a photo-less product instead of a bad-URL one; a product with no
    photos in fact fails **more** reliably than one with a bad `http://`
    URL, not less. Every Google adapter test fixture that used to resolve
    with `attachments: []` (asserting a successful publish, predating this
    validation) now includes a real HTTPS photo instead
    (`google.adapter.publish.test.js`/`google.adapter.batch.test.js`), and
    `google.adapter.publish.test.js`/`google.adapter.image-validation.test.js`
    each gained a dedicated zero-photo rejection test.
  - **`UPLOADS_URL` is exactly what this validation is guarding against.**
    Every `Attachment.url` (what `resolved.photos[].url` ultimately is) is
    built by `utils/attachment.js#buildAttachmentUrl` as literally
    `` `${config.uploads.url}/${fileName}` `` — there is no other source for
    an attachment's URL. Local dev's `.env.example` default,
    `UPLOADS_URL=http://localhost:7000/uploads`, is neither `https://` nor
    publicly reachable, so **every** image on a locally-running tenant would
    now fail this exact check the moment a product actually has a photo
    (harmless in dev — nothing here is really being submitted to Google).
    **In production, `UPLOADS_URL` MUST be set to a real, publicly
    reachable `https://` host** serving the same `/uploads/<filename>`
    paths (a CDN in front of the uploads volume, or the API's own public
    HTTPS domain) — the same variable eBay's `resolveImageUrls` has always
    silently depended on for the same reason; Google's adapter just used to
    have no check that would ever say so out loud.

### Connect flow (TASK 4 — consent first, account picked after)

Previously, `GET /google/oauth/connect-url` required `merchantId`,
`feedLabel`, `contentLanguage` AND `targetCountry` up front, signed all four
into the OAuth `state`, and `oauthCallback` did the entire connect
(`ensureDataSource` + persist) in one shot. Problem: a typo'd `merchantId`
either failed confusingly or silently pointed the connection at the wrong
account, and the tenant had to know their Merchant Center ID before ever
granting consent.

Restructured into two authenticated steps either side of the OAuth
redirect:

1. **`GET /google/oauth/connect-url`** — no query params any more.
   `google.oauth.service.js#buildConsentUrl({ tenantId })` signs a state
   carrying only `{ tenant_id, purpose }`. **The CSRF-relevant part of this
   mechanism — a signed, time-limited, purpose-checked token round-tripped
   through Google, verified with `resolveState` on the way back — is
   completely unchanged**, it just carries fewer fields now.
2. Google's hosted consent screen.
3. **`GET /google/oauth/callback`** (public, unchanged trust model) —
   `resolveState` → `google.oauth.service.js#savePendingConnection`
   exchanges the code and saves ONLY the token, under a new
   `ChannelConnection` status, `PENDING` (see
   `constants/channel.constants.js`) — no `ensureDataSource` call happens
   here any more, since there's no `merchantId` yet. Redirects to
   `/settings/google?google_connect=choose_account`.
4. **`GET /google/oauth/accounts`** (authenticated) — the dashboard calls
   this on landing back with `choose_account`. Loads the tenant's
   `PENDING` connection's token and calls the Merchant API's
   `accounts.list` (`google.datasource.service.js#listAccounts` — see
   below) to return every Merchant Center account that token can reach, for
   a dropdown. **Never a hard failure for the frontend**: if
   `accounts.list` itself isn't usable for this token for any reason, the
   response is `{ accounts: [], listSupported: false, message }` with a
   200 (not an HTTP error) — `GoogleConnectCard.tsx` falls back to a manual
   Merchant Center ID text field in that case, per the review's own
   explicit fallback instruction.
5. **`POST /google/oauth/complete`** (authenticated) — body
   `{ merchantId, targetCountry, feedLabel?, contentLanguage? }`.
   `feedLabel`/`contentLanguage` are optional and defaulted **server-side**
   (`targetCountry` / `"en"` respectively, in `google.controller.js#completeConnect`
   — not just in the frontend form) — only `merchantId` and `targetCountry`
   are actually required. Re-derives `listAccessibleAccounts` and rejects a
   `merchantId` outside that set BEFORE calling `ensureDataSource`
   (`MERCHANT_NOT_ACCESSIBLE`, 400) whenever that check is available; when
   `accounts.list` itself isn't usable (the same fallback case as step 4),
   this check is skipped and `ensureDataSource`'s own real API call is the
   reachability check instead — its failure surfaces just as loudly, just
   one call later. This is the "server-side validation that the id is
   reachable" the review asked for on the manual-entry fallback path,
   without a redundant extra round trip when the dropdown path already
   validated it. On success, upgrades the `PENDING` row to `CONNECTED`
   (`google.oauth.service.js#completeConnection`) and enqueues the initial
   `sync_batch` — moved here from the old single-shot `oauthCallback`,
   since the data source doesn't exist until this step now.

`GCP_REGISTRATION_PENDING`/`GCP_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` (see the GCP
developer-registration note above) can now only ever surface from step 5,
never step 3 — `ensureDataSource` doesn't run until then. Surfaced as a
`reason` field on the 400 JSON response (not a redirect query param any
more, since this is a normal authenticated POST, not a browser redirect) —
`badRequest()` itself has no `reason` slot (shared by every controller in
the app), so `completeConnect`'s catch block builds that one response
shape directly rather than widening the shared helper for one endpoint.

A reconnect (switching Merchant Center account, or re-authorizing after a
revoked token) runs the exact same 5 steps — `savePendingConnection` and
`completeConnection` both upsert/update the tenant's single
`(tenant_id, platform)` `ChannelConnection` row, same as before.

### Services (`services/google/`)

- `google.oauth.service.js` — consent URL + code exchange + **proactive**
  token refresh, persisted to `ChannelConnection` (unlike eBay, which keeps
  access tokens purely in an in-memory per-tenant cache — see
  `ebay.api.service.js#getAccessToken` — Google's is durable across process
  restarts). A concurrent-refresh race for the same tenant is de-duplicated
  in-process via an in-flight-promise `Map` keyed by tenant id
  (`_refreshInFlight`) — two jobs racing await the SAME refresh rather than
  both hitting Google and both writing back. This is an in-process
  optimization only; two separate **worker processes** could still both
  refresh around the same moment — safe (Mongo's single-document writes are
  atomic, and a "losing" token is simply not reused past its own real
  expiry), just not fully eliminated, since that would need a Redis-backed
  distributed lock this run doesn't add.
- `google.merchant.api.service.js` — pure Merchant API HTTP layer
  (`insertProductInput`, `deleteProductInput`). No documented multi-item
  batch endpoint exists for `productInputs` (unlike the older Content API's
  `products.custombatch`) — `publishBatch` (adapter) calls this once per
  item under bounded concurrency instead of guessing at an endpoint shape
  that might not exist.
- `google.datasource.service.js` — creates/resolves the tenant's primary
  product data source. Called during **connect**
  (`google.oauth.service.js#completeConnection`), not lazily on first sync —
  a data source must exist before any push succeeds. Also home to every
  other raw `accounts/v1` HTTP call: `registerGcp`/`getAccountForGcpRegistration`
  (TASK 3 — see above) and `listAccounts` (TASK 4 — `GET accounts/v1/accounts?pageSize=250`,
  confirmed against Google's own guide, not a raw live call from this app
  yet — returns every account this token's user can access, mapped to
  `{ accountId, accountName }` pairs; a tenant realistically manages a
  handful of Merchant Center accounts, so only the first page is fetched).

`packCiphertext`/`unpackCiphertext` were extracted from
`ebay.settings.service.js` (which had its own private copy) into
`utils/crypto/tokenCipher.js` as a shared, generic util — Google's new code
uses the shared version; `ebay.settings.service.js`'s own copy is
**deliberately left untouched** (this run may not edit anything under
`services/ebay/`), so it's temporarily duplicated rather than unified. A
future pass that's allowed to touch that file should switch it to import
the shared copy and delete its own.

### Batch sync (`sync_batch`)

A full catalogue sync is thousands of products — one `sync_listing` job per
product isn't acceptable for a feed channel.

- `sync.service.js#syncBatch(platform, tenantId)` reads the tenant's
  `ACTIVE` listings for a platform via a **Mongo cursor** (never loads the
  whole catalogue into memory), in chunks of
  `config.channels.batchChunkSize` (default 500, env
  `CHANNEL_BATCH_CHUNK_SIZE`).
- Per chunk: resolves each listing, re-checks each one's fencing token in
  **one batched query** (not per-item) right before dispatch — a listing
  whose `last_pushed_seq` has moved past the `push_seq` captured off the
  cursor was already synced more recently by something else (typically a
  single-listing job) and is dropped, exactly like `syncListing`'s own
  `seq < last_pushed_seq` check, just re-verified fresh instead of trusting
  a value read possibly much earlier in the cursor pass. A successful
  write uses `$max` on `last_pushed_seq`, never a blind `$set`, so it can
  never regress it backward either.
- Calls `adapter.publishBatch(resolvedChunk, settings)` **once per chunk**;
  every item's own success/failure/skip is recorded individually
  (`ChannelSyncLog` row per failure/skip; success respects
  `config.channels.logSuccesses` same as `syncListing`) — a per-item failure
  never fails the rest of the chunk, and never trips the circuit breaker
  (that's a product-data problem, not a connection-health one — only the
  *chunk dispatch call itself* throwing counts toward the breaker, in
  `syncBatch`'s own `catch`).
- Queue wiring (`channel.worker.js#attachSyncBatchProcessor`): attached only
  for an adapter with `capabilities.batch === true` and a real
  `publishBatch` export. `sync_batch` jobs carry `{ tenantId }` and get
  Bull's default auto-generated id/opts — **no debounce jobId** (that logic
  in `channel.queue.js` is keyed to the literal string `"sync_listing"`, so
  it was verified to need zero changes for a new job type to safely avoid
  it — see §11). Concurrency defaults to 1 per platform
  (`DEFAULT_BATCH_CONCURRENCY`) — a full-catalogue sync is already
  internally chunked/concurrent; running many tenants' full syncs at once
  on one platform's queue would just contend with itself.
- Triggered once, automatically, right after a successful Google connect
  (`google.controller.js#oauthCallback`) — this run doesn't add a separate
  manual "resync everything" admin route, since nothing else needed one yet
  (see that controller's own `NOTE`). A future manual-trigger route would
  just call `enqueueChannelJob(platform, "sync_batch", { tenantId })` the
  same way.

### Refresh sweep (`refresh_stale`)

Google Merchant Center expires a product that isn't refreshed within a
regular cadence — Google's own guidance: "you should update or refresh them
with a regular cadence (at least every 30 days)". This app's own sync only
fires on a stock change or at connect time, and most auto parts have stable
stock, so a listing that never changes would otherwise quietly drop off
Google after 30 days — no error, no log, nothing in the UI. Closed by:

- **`refreshIntervalDays`** — a new *optional* field on the adapter contract
  (see §1 / `registry.js`'s interface comment): `<number|null>`, the number
  of days after `synced_at` before a listing counts as stale for this
  platform. `null`/absent means "this platform never expires listings".
  Google's adapter sets it to `config.channels.refreshIntervalDays` (default
  **25** — deliberately under Google's real 30-day cap, to leave headroom
  for a missed sweep run or a transient failure before the actual deadline).
  eBay's adapter is **never edited** to add this field — absent is opt-out,
  and the scheduler/sweep both treat "missing" as that platform's explicit
  choice, so an adapter that never sets it needs zero code changes.
- **`services/marketplace/refresh.service.js#sweepStaleListings(platformKey)`**
  — for each tenant with a `ChannelConnection` for that platform, finds
  `MarketplaceListing` docs where `state: active` and
  `synced_at < now - refreshIntervalDays` via a Mongo **cursor**, chunks
  them at `config.channels.batchChunkSize` (the SAME constant `syncBatch`
  uses — no second chunk-size constant introduced), and enqueues one
  `sync_batch` job per chunk with `{ tenantId, listingIds }`. Re-uses the
  EXISTING `sync_batch` job/processor (see `sync.service.js#syncBatch`'s new
  `opts.listingIds`, additive — an existing caller passing no `listingIds`
  is unaffected and still means "every ACTIVE listing") rather than adding a
  second push mechanism, so a refresh re-push inherits that path's chunking,
  fencing (`processBatchChunk`'s existing batched re-check), circuit
  breaker wiring, and `ChannelSyncLog` rows for free.
  - `synced_at: null` (never successfully published) is explicitly excluded
    via `{ $ne: null, $lt: staleBefore }`, not just `{ $lt: staleBefore }`
    alone — MongoDB's BSON type ordering places `Null` **below** `Date`, so
    a bare `$lt` on a Date field actually matches `null` too. That listing
    belongs to the normal publish path, not this sweep.
  - Reuses the exact "not connected" (`adapter.loadSettings` resolving to
    `null`) and "breaker gated" (`circuitBreaker.isOpen`) determinations
    `sync.service.js#syncListing`/`syncBatch` already make — not
    reimplemented here — to skip a tenant whose connection isn't usable.
  - Logs one summary line per tenant (`N stale listing(s) found, M
    sync_batch job(s) enqueued`) — the only visibility into whether the
    sweep is doing anything.
  - A kill switch (`config.channels.refreshSweepEnabled`, env
    `CHANNEL_REFRESH_SWEEP_ENABLED`, default `true`) is checked FIRST, at
    sweep time — so it takes effect on the very next scheduled run with no
    restart/redeploy needed to unregister the repeatable job itself.
- **`workers/channel.worker.js#attachRefreshStaleScheduler`** — registers a
  `refresh_stale` processor + repeatable job (`config.channels.
  refreshSweepIntervalHours`, env `CHANNEL_REFRESH_SWEEP_INTERVAL_HOURS`,
  default **24** hours), following the SAME pattern as eBay's
  `poll_orders`/`poll_inventory` (`attachEbayPolling`), including the same
  stale-repeatable-schedule cleanup on boot (Bull keys a repeatable job by
  its interval, not just its jobId — changing the interval between deploys
  would otherwise register a second schedule in Redis alongside the old
  one). Attached in `startChannelWorker`'s per-adapter loop, gated ONLY on
  `adapter.refreshIntervalDays` being truthy — eBay ends up with no
  `refresh_stale` processor and no repeatable schedule at all, verified live
  (booted the worker with both adapters registered: Google's queue shows a
  `refresh_stale` repeatable job, eBay's shows only its existing
  `poll_orders`/`poll_inventory` — see the verification report).
  `refresh_stale`'s own repeatable registration calls `queue.add()` directly
  (same as `poll_orders`/`poll_inventory`), never going through
  `enqueueChannelJob`, so `channel.queue.js`'s debounce logic (keyed to the
  literal string `"sync_listing"` — see §11) never enters into it at all;
  the `sync_batch` jobs the sweep itself enqueues go through
  `enqueueChannelJob` normally but, same as the post-connect full sync,
  never match that debounce condition either.
- Shutdown: `refresh_stale`'s processor is attached to the SAME per-platform
  queue object `attachSyncListingProcessor` already pushed into
  `activeQueues` — `shutdown()`'s existing `Promise.all(activeQueues.map(q
  => q.close()))` drains it with zero changes needed there.

### Routes

`routes/google.routes.js` — OAuth connect flow
(`GET /oauth/connect-url`, `GET /oauth/callback`, and, since TASK 4,
`GET /oauth/accounts` + `POST /oauth/complete` — see "Connect flow" above),
mirroring `ebay.routes.js`'s own OAuth section. Status/logs/retry are
already generic — `GET /api/v1/channels`, `GET /api/v1/channels/:platform/logs`,
`POST /api/v1/channels/:platform/retry/:logId` all already work for Google
with zero Google-specific code, once `registerAdapters.js` registers the
adapter — that's the entire point of the generic layer built in §1–§8.

## 10. What a third channel (e.g. Meta Shop) would need

Queues, `ChannelSyncLog`, circuit breaker, generic routes, category mappings,
the resolver's hydration and the product form's Sales Channels section are all
generic. A third channel needs:

1. **The adapter** — `key`, `manifest` (including `fieldSchema`; see §13),
   `capabilities`, `loadSettings` (via `channelConnection.service.js`, returning
   `null` when not connected), `publish`/`update`/`end`, optionally
   `publishBatch`. Keep it a **pure translator**: declare I/O in `needs` and read
   it from `resolved` (`stock`, `productUrl`, `branding`, `category`,
   `identifiers`). If a lookup you need isn't hydrated yet, add it to
   `listing.resolver.js#hydrateResolved` behind a new `needs` flag, batched per
   chunk, rather than querying from the adapter.
2. **`fieldSchema`** in its own `adapters/<platform>.fieldSchema.js` — only fields
   the adapter actually reads, plus a `fieldValues(listing, ctx)` mapping to
   effective values. Enforce it in the mapper with `fieldSchema.js#assertFieldValues`.
   Declare `categoryField` if the channel has a category taxonomy; category
   mappings then work with no further code.
3. **Its own OAuth/credential flow** — reuse `utils/crypto/tokenCipher.js`; never
   hardcode an environment base URL (see the `*.environment-invariants.test.js` files).
4. **A `ChannelConnection` discriminator** named `"ChannelConnection<Name>"`, and a
   `MarketplaceListing` discriminator for its listing-level fields.
5. **Attach `.status` to every thrown error** from its HTTP layer
   (`circuitBreaker.js#isTransportOrAuthFailure`).
6. **Error out loudly, never guess**, for anything it can't resolve with confidence.
7. Register it in `registerAdapters.js`; add its OAuth routes and a listing
   CREATE/UPDATE route pair (there is still no generic create route).
8. **Frontend:** one entry in `src/lib/marketplace/channelForms.ts`
   (`CHANNEL_FORM_ADAPTERS`) wiring its create/update calls. Its panel then renders
   from `fieldSchema` automatically; add a component to
   `src/components/channels/channelFieldRegistry.tsx` only for a field the generic
   renderer can't express.
9. **Opt into the refresh sweep** with `refreshIntervalDays` only if the platform
   expires stale listings.

## 11. Generic-layer changes made for Google (eBay impact, file by file)

Every file below was touched because Google genuinely needed it (the second
group of bullets covers the later refresh-sweep addition specifically) —
per this run's own invariants, each change is additive or capability-gated,
and every existing eBay test still passes unmodified (see the verification
report). Nothing under `services/ebay/` or `adapters/ebay.adapter.js` was
touched at all.

- **`listing.resolver.js`** — added `resolveProductUrl`/`resolveIdentifiers`
  as new exports. `resolveListing` (eBay's only entry point here) is
  byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **`sync.service.js`** — added `syncBatch`/`processBatchChunk`/
  `getListingPushSeq` (new exports); added ONE new branch in `syncListing`
  gated on `ids?.skipped` (an adapter opting into the new "skip this sync
  entirely" signal) — eBay's adapter never sets this field, so the branch
  is dead code for eBay, verified by every existing eBay-path test still
  passing. Also threads `err.code` into `logSyncEvent`'s existing call
  (was always `null` before for every adapter — additive, no behavior
  change for a plain `Error`).
- **`channel.worker.js`** — added `attachSyncBatchProcessor` /
  `SYNC_BATCH_CONCURRENCY`, called only for an adapter that declares
  `capabilities.batch`. eBay's `attachSyncListingProcessor` call and its
  own concurrency/mid-flight-recovery logic are unchanged.
- **`channel.queue.js`** — **not modified**. Verified (not assumed) that
  the existing debounce condition is keyed to the literal string
  `"sync_listing"` (`jobName === "sync_listing"`), so a `"sync_batch"` job
  never matches it and never inherits the debounce jobId — no code change
  needed for this invariant to hold.
- **`registerAdapters.js`** — one added `registry.register(googleAdapter)`
  line.
- **`models/MarketplaceListing.js` / `models/ChannelConnection.js`** — new
  `google` discriminators only; the base schemas and the `ebay`
  discriminators are unchanged.
- **`constants/marketplace.constants.js`** — added `GOOGLE: "google"` to
  the enum; `EBAY` unchanged.
- **`config/index.js`** — added a `google` block; `ebay`/`channels` blocks
  unchanged.
- **`utils/crypto/tokenCipher.js`** — added `packCiphertext`/
  `unpackCiphertext` as new exports (extracted from
  `ebay.settings.service.js`'s own private copy, left in place — see §9).
  `encrypt`/`decrypt` unchanged.
- **`routes/index.js`** — one added `router.use("/google", ...)` line;
  the `/ebay` line is untouched.

**Refresh sweep (later addition, same invariants):**

- **`services/marketplace/refresh.service.js`** (new file) —
  `sweepStaleListings`, the entire sweep implementation (see §9's "Refresh
  sweep" subsection).
- **`registry.js`** — documented `refreshIntervalDays` in the interface
  comment block only; no code change (the field is read directly off
  whatever adapter object `getAdapter` returns, same as `capabilities`).
- **`adapters/google.adapter.js`** — added `refreshIntervalDays` (new
  export, reading `config.channels.refreshIntervalDays`) and the `config`
  require it needed. Nothing else in the file changed.
- **`sync.service.js`** — `syncBatch` gained an *optional*
  `opts.listingIds` filter (additive: restricts the cursor to a specific
  id set instead of "every ACTIVE listing" — an existing caller passing no
  `listingIds`, including every existing test and the post-connect full
  sync, is unaffected).
- **`channel.worker.js`** — added `attachRefreshStaleScheduler` (called
  only for `adapter.refreshIntervalDays` truthy — eBay's adapter never
  sets it, so eBay is unaffected) and threaded `job.data.listingIds`
  through `attachSyncBatchProcessor`'s existing `sync_batch` processor
  into `syncBatch`'s new opt (a job with no `listingIds`, e.g. the
  post-connect full sync, behaves exactly as before). Also added a
  `config` require (previously unused in this file).
- **`config/index.js`** — added `refreshIntervalDays` /
  `refreshSweepIntervalHours` / `refreshSweepEnabled` to the existing
  `channels` block; every other key in that block is unchanged.
- **`.env.example`** — documented the 3 new `CHANNEL_REFRESH_*` vars;
  nothing existing was changed.

## 12. Operator scripts

### `scripts/registerGoogleGcp.js` (TASK 3)

One-off CLI tool an operator runs directly — deliberately **not** wired
into the tenant connect flow (`google.controller.js`), which already
self-heals `GCP_NOT_REGISTERED` on its own (see §9's "GCP project developer
registration" note). This script exists for registering (or checking) a
Merchant Center account's registration explicitly, ahead of a tenant ever
attempting to connect, or to diagnose what a given GCP project is currently
registered to.

```
node scripts/registerGoogleGcp.js --account=<merchant center id> --email=<developer email> [--dry-run]
```

- Performs its own interactive, out-of-band OAuth consent exchange (prints
  a consent URL, the operator approves it, pastes back the resulting
  `code`) — there's no `ChannelConnection` token to reuse before a tenant
  has ever successfully connected, which is the exact situation this script
  is for. Reuses `google.oauth.service.js#exchangeCodeForTokens` for the
  actual token exchange rather than reimplementing it.
- Calls `google.datasource.service.js#registerGcp(token, account, email)` —
  that function gained an optional third `developerEmail` argument for this
  (Google's documented request body for `registerGcp` is `{ developerEmail
  }`; the pre-existing auto-recovery caller in `createDataSource` still
  omits it, unchanged, so this is additive).
- Verifies success afterward via the new
  `google.datasource.service.js#getAccountForGcpRegistration(token)` — a
  standalone, no-`merchantId` GET (`accounts/v1/accounts:getAccountForGcpRegistration`)
  that reports which account (if any) the calling GCP project — identified
  implicitly by the token's client credentials — is currently registered
  to. **NOTE:** this endpoint's exact response shape was cross-checked
  against Google's own documentation search index and the sibling
  `registerGcp` response shape (`{ name, gcpIds }`), not a raw confirmed
  example response for this specific method — flagged rather than silently
  assumed correct; cross-check against a real call before leaning on it
  for anything beyond this script's own human-readable printout.
- `--dry-run` skips the actual `registerGcp` write but still exchanges a
  token and runs the verification GET, so an operator can check current
  registration status non-destructively.
- Maps Google's three documented `registerGcp` restrictions (test accounts
  ineligible; target account needs a claimed+verified website; a
  subaccount can't be registered while authenticated as its parent/MCA) to
  a human-readable explanation via keyword-matching the raw error body —
  **best-effort**, not confirmed exact error strings for each case (this
  app has only ever seen `GCP_NOT_REGISTERED`/`ALREADY_REGISTERED` live).
  Google's raw error is always printed alongside, never replaced by it.

## 13. Product as the single source of truth (overrides, category mappings, fieldSchema, adapter purity)

### Overrides mean override

`title_override` / `description_override` / `price_override` / `photo_overrides`
default to empty and are never prefilled from the product. Empty means "use the
live product value" (`listing.resolver.js#resolveListing`). The product form shows
the product value as a placeholder, with a per-field "Using product value" /
"Overridden" state and a reset (`src/components/listings/OverrideField.tsx`).

eBay's HTML description used to be generated **in the browser** on every save and
stored as `description_override`, which froze a copy of the title, MPN, fitment and
so on. It is now rendered **server-side at push time**
(`services/ebay/ebay.description.template.js`, a byte-identical mirror of the
frontend generator, which is kept only for the preview) whenever there is no
override. A real custom description can still be set as an override.

Title limits are validated on the **effective** title (override, else product):
`validators/ebay.listing.validation.js`, `manifest.productConstraints`
(checked by `fieldSchema.js#assertProductConstraints` in the mapper) and the frontend.

Migration: `scripts/backfillClearCopiedOverrides.js [--dry-run] [--tenant=<id>]
[--include-generated-descriptions]` clears an override only when removing it
leaves the pushed value unchanged (it compares against `resolveListing` with the
override removed). Every write re-checks the stored value, so the script is
idempotent and race-safe. Generated eBay descriptions are cleared only with the
opt-in flag.

### Fields on both Product and a listing: null means "use the product"

**Rule.** A field that exists on both `Product` and a listing discriminator MUST
default to `null` (or empty) and fall back to the product value. A listing field
holds a value only when it is genuinely channel-specific (eBay category id,
business policies, store SKU) or a deliberate override. This bug class has now
appeared three times (title/description/price/photos, then condition and
authenticity, then fitment): a listing default such as `condition: "NEW"` silently
shadowed the product, so product edits queued a sync that pushed the old value.

Resolution (`services/marketplace/productFallbacks.js`, exposed on `resolved`):

| Resolved field | Listing value (override) | Else product |
|---|---|---|
| `condition` | eBay `condition` / Google `condition` | `product.condition` |
| `authenticity` | eBay `item_specifics.authenticity` | `product.authenticity` |
| `fitment` | eBay `fitment[]` rows naming a make or model | `[product.vehicle]` (one row) |
| `brand`, `mpn` | `item_specifics.brand` / `.mpn`, Google `mpn` | `product.brand` / `.mpn` |

`""` counts as unset. Platform vocabularies are mapped in the adapter, not stored:
eBay `resolveCategoryCondition` maps the **resolved** condition to what the
category accepts (`USED` → `USED_EXCELLENT`); Google's `toGoogleCondition` maps
`NEW`/`USED` to `new`/`used`. `product.vehicle` → `fitment[]` is a shape change and
lives in the resolver so any channel can use it.

**Enforced in CI** by `models/productListingOverlap.test.js`: it compares Product
leaf field names with each discriminator's own (recursing into subdocuments and
arrays) and fails on any overlap missing from its commented `ALLOWED_OVERLAPS`,
on any allowlisted field whose default isn't null/empty, and on stale entries.

The product fan-out list (`controllers/product.controller.js`,
`MARKETPLACE_RELEVANT_PRODUCT_FIELDS`) must include every product field a channel
reads, compared by value: title, description, price, brand, mpn, condition,
authenticity, vehicle, slug (Google link), stock_control, shipping_cost (Google),
attachments, categories (mapped channel category). `sku` is excluded on purpose:
it is the channel identity, and re-pushing a changed SKU creates a new item.

The channel panel shows each inherited value read-only with "from product", plus
an explicit "Override for <channel>" control; an override is flagged and resettable
(`fieldSchema` descriptors carry `inheritsFrom: "<product field>"`).

Migration: `scripts/backfillClearCopiedChannelFields.js [--dry-run] [--tenant=<id>]`
nulls a listing value only when it pushes the same thing as the product would;
different values are real overrides and are kept. eBay `condition: "NEW"` on a
product that is not new is **ambiguous** (it was the old default, and nothing
records whether a user chose it): the script leaves it and reports the count
and sample ids for a person to decide.

### Category mappings

`CategoryMapping { tenant_id, product_category_id, platform, external_category_id,
external_category_name }`, unique on `{ tenant_id, product_category_id, platform }`.
Managed at Settings › Integrations › Channel Categories (`/api/v1/category-mappings`).

Resolution order (`listing.resolver.js#hydrateResolved` → `applyMappedCategories`):

1. the listing's own value (`adapter.categoryField`), shown as "Set on this product";
2. the tenant's mapping for the **first** product category, in the product's own
   order, that has one, shown as "From category default";
3. unset: the panel asks for a value (required for eBay, optional for Google).

Mappings are **not** copied onto listings, so editing a mapping moves every listing
that relies on it. A verified auto-parts subset of Google's taxonomy
(`constants/googleProductCategory.constants.js`, version 2021-09-21) is the default
pick-list, and name-based suggestions are shown, never auto-applied. No eBay
category ids are shipped; they must come from eBay's live category search.

### fieldSchema contract

`manifest.fieldSchema`: an ordered list of
`{ key, label, type, required, helpText, optionsSource?, group?, inheritsFrom? }` covering **only**
what the channel needs beyond the product. `type` is one of `text | textarea |
number | boolean | select | category | policy | custom`. `GET /api/v1/channels`
serves it with static option lists attached as `options`; dynamic sources (eBay
business policies) are fetched by the UI. `required` means the **effective** value
(listing value, else mapping or tenant default).

Enforced server-side in the mapper (`services/marketplace/fieldSchema.js`,
`ChannelFieldValidationError`, status 400, code `FIELD_VALIDATION`):

| Rule | Where |
|---|---|
| eBay effective title ≤ 80 | `ebay.adapter.js#assertUpfrontFields`, before any write; also `validateListingForPush` |
| eBay effective condition required (listing, else product); format enum; best-offer number | `assertUpfrontFields` (publish + update) |
| eBay category required | `publish()`, same point as before (after the inventory-item write); `update()` keeps its "skip the offer" path; also `validateListingForPush` |
| eBay business policies required (listing value or tenant default) | `publish()` before the offer is created; `validateListingForPush` |
| Google condition enum | `google.adapter.js#assertGoogleFields` (publish, update, per batch item) |

### Adapter purity

Adapters take data in, call the platform API and return a result. Everything
I/O-backed is resolved beforehand by `sync.service.js` / `listing.resolver.js`:

- `resolved.stock = { stock_control, quantity }`: one batched aggregate per chunk
  (`inventory.service.js#getTotalStockForProductVariants`). eBay and Google
  genuinely differ here and both behaviours are kept. eBay treats a falsy
  `stock_control` (including unset) as "send no quantity"; Google excludes only
  `stock_control === false`.
- `resolved.productUrl` / `productUrlError`: the storefront host is resolved once
  per chunk, and the error is raised by the adapter at its original point.
- `resolved.branding`, `resolved.category`, `resolved.identifiers`.
- `resolved.condition`, `resolved.authenticity`, `resolved.fitment`: listing
  override, else product (see "Fields on both Product and a listing" above).
  Adapters never read `listing.condition` or `listing.item_specifics.authenticity`.
- The sync baseline is written by `sync.service.js#recordQuantityPushed` via
  `hooks.onQuantityPushed`, at the exact point the adapter used to write it.
- `end(listing, context)` receives product/variant/settings/SKU from
  `sync.service.js#loadEndContext`.
- In `sync_batch`, a hydration failure becomes a per-item failure
  (`resolved.hydrationError`), matching the old per-item lookups.

### Retired / renamed

- `queues/ebay.queue.js` and `registerEnqueueOverride`: removed (see §4).
- `models/EbayProcessedOrder.js` → `models/ChannelProcessedEvent.js`, pinned to the
  legacy collection `ebayprocessedorders` (no data migration).
- `workers/ebay.worker.js`: **kept**. `server/package.json#worker:ebay` still
  references it, and it is the documented target of the old `worker-ebay` compose
  service (§6), so deleting it is blocked until production is confirmed on
  `worker-channels`.
- `EbaySettings`: kept. `scripts/checkEbaySettingsMigrated.js` (read-only; exits 2
  while any tenant is unmigrated) gates its deletion.
- The frontend's `ListingCreatePage` / `ListingEditPage` now redirect to the
  product's Sales Channels section (`/products/:slug/edit?channel=<key>#sales-channels`).
