// The storefront (pha-storefront) is a SEPARATE repo, not this one — its
// product route is `/product/:slug` (singular — see its src/App.tsx).
//
// `platform` is REQUIRED — every real caller (google.adapter.js's two call
// sites) always has one, and this function needs it to know whether the
// linkDomain fallback below is even allowed for that platform at all. Fail
// loudly on a caller that forgets it, rather than silently skipping the
// requiresStorefront check for whoever omits it.
//
// Host resolution, in order:
//   1. The tenant's DEFAULT verified Domain (models/Domain.js — is_default:
//      true, status: active). A non-default active domain does NOT count
//      here, even if one exists — only the one the tenant has actually
//      designated as their default storefront host.
//   2. `<tenant.slug, hyphens stripped>.${config.payment.linkDomain}` — the
//      SAME per-tenant host stripe.payment.service.js#buildPaymentBaseUrl
//      already builds for payment links (and app.js's CORS check already
//      accepts any subdomain of, for that exact reason), reused here rather
//      than invented fresh: the storefront is served on this same per-
//      tenant subdomain regardless of a tenant's payment_domain_mode
//      setting (that field controls payment-link hosting specifically, not
//      the storefront). Hyphens are stripped from the slug for the same
//      reason buildPaymentBaseUrl strips them — see that function's own
//      comment. NOT offered at all to a platform whose manifest declares
//      `requiresStorefront: true` (see channel.service.js#checkStorefrontRequirement,
//      which already refuses to even let such a tenant CONNECT without a
//      verified Domain) — a shared subdomain of this platform's own domain
//      is not something the tenant could claim/verify ownership of with
//      Google, so it was never a legitimate storefront for that channel;
//      letting it through here would have quietly contradicted that
//      connect-time guard for any tenant who got connected some other way
//      (e.g. before the guard existed, or via direct DB access).
// Throws — never guesses — when neither a verified default Domain NOR (for
// a platform that's allowed to use it) the linkDomain fallback resolves to
// something real. tenant.slug itself is a required, always-present field
// (models/Tenant.js), so once linkDomain is configured (and allowed) that
// fallback is always resolvable — the only other failure mode guarded here
// is the tenant record itself somehow not resolving at all (deleted mid-request).
//
// Product.slug is NOT a required field (models/Product.js) — a product
// with none fails loudly, naming the SKU, rather than building a URL with
// an empty/undefined path segment.
