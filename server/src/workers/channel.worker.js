// Consolidated worker: registers every marketplace adapter, then attaches a
// sync_listing processor for each one's queue, at per-platform concurrency
// (eBay stays at its existing concurrency — see SYNC_LISTING_CONCURRENCY),
// plus eBay's own order/inventory polling — not part of the generic adapter
// contract (no other platform has an equivalent yet), so it's wired
// separately rather than through the generic per-platform loop below. See
// server/docs/channel-architecture.md.
//
// Can run standalone (every registered platform — the default when this
// file is run directly) or restricted to a subset via startChannelWorker's
// `platforms` option — see workers/ebay.worker.js, which delegates here
// restricted to just "ebay" so the OLD docker-compose (worker-ebay: node
// src/workers/ebay.worker.js) keeps booting correctly if deployed before
// the compose change (worker-ebay -> worker-channels) lands.

// jobId returns the existing (active) job rather than creating a new one:
// a stock change's fan-out call landing in that window is silently
// swallowed. Concretely:
//   t=0  job J starts syncing listing L, resolves quantity 5
//   t=1  stock changes to 3 -> fan-out bumps push_seq -> enqueues
//        sync:ebay:L -> J is ACTIVE under that id -> Bull returns the

//        nothing is queued; eBay shows 5, local stock is 3, no error logged

// be swallowed the same way. Verified for bull@4.16.5 (this repo's pinned

// job.moveToCompleted() (the call that performs the Redis-side removal)
// BEFORE emitting "completed" — see node_modules/bull/lib/queue.js — so by
// the time this handler runs, the jobId is guaranteed free and a
// re-enqueue here creates a genuinely new job rather than being swallowed.
